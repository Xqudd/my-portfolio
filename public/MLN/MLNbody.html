      { title: "My writing Identity", text: "For me, writing is a tool I prefer and think best used to both excel academically and express my personal beliefs and values on topics. Several important characteristics of an environment that crafts one's writing identity are identity kits, Discourse, and sponsors of literacy.  My personal writing identity was crafted through the changing of Discourse communities that shaped my identity kit, and literacy sponsors, some of which have discouraged, and some have encouraged my writing. Additionally, due to the frequent changing of environments that I have been through, I have come to value the importance of switching and meshing my language variety not based on the Discourse community I am communicating too but based on the social context of the literacy. " },
      { title: "Sponsors of Literacy", text: "Brandt defines sponsors as \"any agents, local or distant, concrete or abstract, who enable, support, teach, model, as well as recruit, regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy-and gain advantage by it in some way.\"" },
      { title: "My sponsors", text: "Years of literacy sponsors pill up cumulating to shape one`s education and even values. The quality and quantity of the literacy sponsors that are presented to an individual are critical to one`s success. Inherently as access to literacy varies between people due to circumstance, the amount of doors of opportunity one has access to throughout their life varies. In my personal narrative of literacy, I have been particularly fortunate in the number of doors that have been placed in front of me as well as the quantity and quality of sponsors of literacy. From a very young age, even before kindergarten, my parents and my grandmother had me practicing my times tables at dinner and learning to read. This gave me an early lead over my classmates as I began school, allowing me to be placed in the honors program fairly early on. Interestingly, my handwriting lacked behind the curve due to my lack of interest in practicing when my grandmother insisted. This was never flagged by my teachers early in my academic journey as a problem because my reading skills were good enough to keep my English grades high. To this day, due to this oversite, my handwriting is very poor, even illegible to some. This has had the obvious effect of me preferring to type written assignments, but it also has caused me, when writing for myself, to prefer the handwritten form of literature. That, of course, can be referred to as a type of codeswitching and will be discussed more extensively later. I went to a charter school throughout most of elementary school, attending one of the leading elementary schools in Colorado, having access to excellent literacy sponsors that gave me a hunger for education at an early age. This hunger for education continued throughout elementary, middle, and high school, even leading to me to choose to pursue a higher education at UCF. I believe that this hunger for education has also shaped my writing style, particularly in the style that I write written essays. There have only ever been two pieces of literature that I have read that have stood out to me in a very significant manner: \"Into the Wild\" by Jon Krakauer and \"Outliers: The Story of Success\" by Malcolm Gladwell. I have read both novels several times and written my own pieces of literature on similar topics as the topics seen in each of the two novels. I think due to this I began naturally incorporating pieces of the writing styles Jon Krakauer and Malcolm Gladwell incorporated into parts of my writing style." },
      { title: "Discourse", text: "Gee`s Discourse, with a capital D, is simply an identity kit and taking on a particular style of writing or speaking that others with recognize. One acquires a Discourse through, as Gee puts it, cognition. Gee also states that many Discourses come from Discourse communities, which is a community with a common Discourse working towards a common goal." },
      {title: "Changing Discourses", text: "My associations with different Discourse communities have also had a significant effect on shaping my personal writing identity, particularly in how those Discourse communities have changed over the years. Before 4th grade the groups of Discourse communities that shaped my identity kit, and my writing identity were consistent and didn`t change much. I had the same friend group, was in the same cub scout troop, lived in the same place and went to the same school all the way from kindergarten to 4th grade. However, following my 4th grade school year, the school I attended changed every year up to 9th grade, causing a shift in my Discourse community each year: living in different areas spanning from the suburbs of Colorado to the countryside of Tennessee to St. Augustine, Florida; being a part of several different Boyscout and Cubscout troops; and having a completely new set of friends each year. This constant changing of Discourse communities has led to me being skilled in meshing and switching literacy types; more particularly, I switch not necessarily based on the discourse community I am speaking or writing to but based on the social context of the literacy. For example, consider a Discourse community of three people all working together on the common goal of learning history. That Discourse community consists of you (a student), another student and a teacher. Consider two scenarios: the teacher asks you a question about history, and the other student asks you a question about history. Both scenarios originate from the same Discourse community. Therefore, someone who states they codeswitch or codemesh based on their Discourse community would not need to do so between the two scenarios and would respond the same way. As stated previously, due to experience with extensive changing of Discourse communities, I switch and mesh literacy varieties based on the social context of the literacy, not the Discourse community itself. So, I would respond differently in both scenarios, because the social context of speaking to a teacher is different than the social context of speaking to a friend, even though they both originate from the same Discourse community. My preferred medium of writing also varies because of both my personal identity kit and the social context of literacy. For example, in the social context of writing something for myself, such as a to-do list or a personal calendar, I prefer a handwriting medium of literature. However, in the social context of writing a work order request I prefer a typed email. Between meshing and mixing the medium and language variety of my literacy I believe I am effectively and acceptably able to communicate to a diverse audience in a variety of settings."},
      {title: "Codeswitching and Codemeshing", text: "Tremain talks about two terms, codemeshing and codeswitching, and how they are connecting to discourse communities. She talks about how langauge is connected to power, in the sense that certain discourse community will have a better view of you based on your langauge variety, and that chagnes from discourse community to discourse community. Hence, in order to best fit it to all of your discourse communities, you must switch and mesh your language varieties."},
      {title: "When I switch and mesh", text: "Up until this point I have been very careful not to specify whether I codeswitch or codemesh in different scenarios, usually even avoiding both terms completely by stating \"switching and meshing my language variety\". I think for this literacy narrative to be complete, a guideline or set of rules on what social contexts my personal writing identity leads me to codeswitch or codemesh. However, I don`t think my writing identity has a be-all end-all rule for what types of writing and what social context makes it best to codeswitch or codemesh, or when best to do neither. However, since I have placed myself in many social contexts in the past I have developed a good sense of when to do what when it comes to codeswitch and codemeshing. I think to best to describe when my personal writing identity leads me to codeswitch and when it leads me to codemesh I should first define each of those terms in my own words, so you know in what sense I mean each word. For me, when one codeswitches that means they, to the fullest extent of their ability, for some or the full length of the literacy one codeswitched for, completely changed their language variety from the one that best fits their writing identity to one that best fits the social context of the literacy. When one codemeshes that means they, for some or the full length of the literacy one codemeshed for, intentionally and only partially changed their language variety from the variety that best fits their writing identity to align more closely with one that best fits the social context of the literacy. Because it is complicated to come up with a set of rules that align with my writing identity when it comes to codemeshing or codeswitching, I think it would be best to provide several example social contexts and scenarios of when my personal writing identity leads me to believe it would be best to or to not codemesh or codeswitch and what event(s) from my past have led me to choose to do that in each particular case. In many formal social settings, I believe it is important to consider that you should speak or write in a language variety that is socially considered formal, and hence acceptable for that setting. Because of my time in Tennessee, my writing identity leads me to say y`all and ain`t on occasion. For example, I consider scholarly settings such as class or writing an essay to be formal, and I consider the American southern language variety to not be formal, so I avoid using terms like y`all and ain`t in many scholarly settings. However, if that scholarly setting was in the deep south, I would consider it acceptable to use y`all and ain`t, and many of my teachers from Tennessee were fine with that. In nonformal formal settings, however, in which the individual or group I am communicating too uses a different language variety than me, I think codemeshing your language variety with theirs for the duration of the literacy would be beneficial only in the case in which you plan to have frequent social interactions with individuals who inhabit that language variety. However, in the event you only have one interaction with that group or individual, it is not necessary wise to codemesh, because I don`t think you would benefit greatly from a interaction so brief, and it might be considered weird if you talk in someone else`s language variety the first time you talk to them. It is also good to consider how for some individuals like myself codeswitching or codemeshing to certain language varieties may be considered inappropriate or perhaps even cultural appropriation. In a scenario in which I am speaking or writing to a group of individuals whose preferred language variety aligns closely with AAVE, I don`t think I should either codeswitch or codemesh. As I have learned through several past social interactions, as a white male who is certainly not colored, it would be considered cultural appropriation for me to speak in AAVE when that is not my language variety, even if that is the preferred language variety of all the other individuals in the social interaction. That same rule can be applied to many but not every social interaction in which you are participating with individuals whose preferred language variety aligns with a language variety of a racial group in which you are not a part of, especially when you are an individual like myself, whose race is historically known for assimilating other races and inappropriately borrowing cultural practices and identities that are specific to another race. However, in some cases of the aforementioned social interaction, it might be best to codeswitch. For example, imagine you are on vacation in a foreign country in which the residents speak a different language than that of your preferred language variety, and it may be impossible or at least very difficult for many residents of that country to understand your preferred language variety. In that scenario, you should codeswitch, that is change your language variety as completely as your ability allows you, to the preferred language of the residents of that country. I learned this on my trip to Japan this past summer. I know a small amount of the Japanese language, enough to ask basic questions and maybe maintain a brief simple conversation, but not nearly enough to be considered fluent. At the beginning of my trip, I avoided using Japanese even when the Japanese individuals I interacted with did not understand much or any English, relying on gestures to refer to things or order when I knew the phrases to say it in the locals preferred language simply because I was worried that as a white man speaking a type of language variety that belongs a racial group I am not a part of might be considered cultural appropriation. However, as my trip went on I came to the obvious conclusion that speaking the preferred language of the individual or group I am speaking with rather than the language I am most comfortable with is beneficial and not necessarily cultural appropriation. I noticed a significant change in how kindly the foreigners spoke to me when I begin codeswitching to their preferred language to the best of my ability. "},
      {title: "Wrapping it up", text: "Due to my past experiences writing in a variety of environments, I have a developed system of meshing and mixing my language variety that allows me to meet social language standards and inhibits communicating effectively to many individuals. The frequent changing of environments has also caused me to experience literature in lots of Discourse communities, which has impacted my writing identity. My past literacy sponsors have either directly helped me develop skills that have impacted my writing identity, or they have done so indirectly by fueling additions to my identity kit that have affected my identity kit.
