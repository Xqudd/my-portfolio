      { title: "My writing Identity", text: "For me, writing is a tool that I prefer and think is best used to both excel academically and express my personal beliefs and values on various topics. Several important characteristics of an environment that craft one's writing identity are identity kits, Discourse, and sponsors of literacy.  My personal writing identity was shaped through the changing Discourse communities that formed my identity kit, and literacy sponsors, some of whom have discouraged, while others have encouraged my writing. Additionally, due to the frequent changing of environments that I have been through, I have come to value the importance of switching and meshing my language variety not based on the Discourse community I am communicating with, but based on the social context of the literacy." },
      { title: "Sponsors of Literacy", text: "Brandt defines sponsors as \"any agents, local or distant, concrete or abstract, who enable, support, teach, model, as well as recruit, regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy, and gain advantage by it in some way.\"" },
      { title: "My sponsors", text: "Years of literacy sponsors pile up, cumulating to shape one’s education and even values. The quality and quantity of the literacy sponsors that are presented to an individual are critical to one’s success. Inherently, as access to literacy varies between people due to circumstance, the number of doors of opportunity one has access to throughout their life varies. In my personal narrative of literacy, I have been particularly fortunate in the number of doors that have been placed in front of me, as well as the quantity and quality of sponsors of literacy. From a very young age, even before kindergarten, my parents and my grandmother had me practicing my times tables at dinner and learning to read. Because of this supplemental education, I enjoyed my first few years of school, especially my math and English classes, as I was ahead in content, because my parents had taught it to me previously. However, rather interestingly, my handwriting lagged behind the curve due to my lack of interest in practicing when my grandmother insisted. This was never flagged by my teachers early in my academic journey as a problem because my reading skills were good enough to keep my English grades high. To this day, due to this oversight, my handwriting is very poor, even illegible to some. This has had the obvious effect of me preferring to type assignments, but it has also caused me, when writing for myself, to prefer the handwritten form of literature. That, of course, can be referred to as a type of codeswitching and will be discussed more extensively later. \n Between my early lead when it comes to my education, due to my parents and grandmother's dedication to make sure I knew basic reading and math skills before I started school, and the fact that I went to a charter school throughout most of elementary school which gave me access to excellent literacy sponsors, I had a hunger for education at an early age. This hunger for education continued throughout elementary, middle, and high school, even leading me to choose to pursue a higher education at UCF. I believe that this hunger for education has also shaped my writing style, particularly in the way that I write essays. In most essays (not this one, however, as it is unusual in the sense that I am just talking about myself), I try to base my tone on that of scholarly pieces of literature that I have read and have stood out to me for some reason. Two specific examples come to mind: \"Into the Wild\" by Jon Krakauer and \"Outliers: The Story of Success\" by Malcolm Gladwell. I have read both novels several times and written my own pieces of literature on similar topics to those seen in each of the two novels. I think due to this, I began naturally incorporating pieces of the writing styles of Jon Krakauer and Malcolm Gladwell into parts of my writing style, and that shines through on many of my school essays due to the scholarly format they naturally take." },
      { title: "Discourse", text: "Gee’s Discourse, with a capital D, is simply a piece of an identity kit and taking on a particular style of writing or speaking that others will recognize. One acquires a Discourse through, as Gee puts it, cognition. Gee also states that many Discourses come from Discourse communities, which are communities with a common Discourse working towards a common goal." },
      {title: "Changing Discourses", text: "My associations with different Discourse communities have also had a significant effect on shaping my personal writing identity, particularly in how those Discourse communities have changed over the years. Before 4th grade, the groups of Discourse communities that shaped my identity kit, and my writing identity were consistent and didn’t change much. I had the same friend group, was in the same Cub Scout troop, lived in the same place, and went to the same school all the way from kindergarten to 4th grade. However, following my 4th grade school year, the school I attended changed every year up to 9th grade, causing a shift in my Discourse community each year: living in different areas spanning from the suburbs of Colorado to the countryside of Tennessee to St. Augustine, Florida; being a part of several different Boyscout and Cubscout troops; and having a completely new set of friends each year. \n This constant change of Discourse communities has led me to develop a skill of meshing and switching literacy types. More particularly, I switch not necessarily based on the discourse community I am speaking or writing to, but based on the social context of the literacy. For example, imagine a Discourse community of three people all working together on the common goal of learning history. That Discourse community consists of you (as a student), another student, and a teacher. Consider two scenarios that might take place revolving this Discourse community: one in which the teacher asks you a question about history, and one in which the other student asks you a question about history. Both scenarios originate from the same Discourse community. Therefore, someone who states they codeswitch or codemesh based on their Discourse community would respond in the same literacy style in both scenarios, as no change of Discourse community is present between the two scenarios. As stated previously, due to experience with extensive changes in Discourse communities, I switch and mesh literacy varieties based on the social context of the literacy, rather than the Discourse community itself. Therefore, I would respond differently in both scenarios. This is because the social context of speaking to a teacher is different than the social context of speaking to a friend, despite the fact that they both originate from the same Discourse community. \n My preferred medium of writing also varies due to my personal identity kit and the social context of literacy. For example, when writing something for myself, such as a to-do list or a personal calendar, I prefer a handwritten medium of literature. However, in the social context of writing a work order request to an individual, I prefer a typed email. Between meshing and mixing the medium and language variety of my literacy, I believe I am effectively and acceptably able to communicate to a diverse audience in a variety of settings."},
      {title: "Codeswitching and Codemeshing", text: "Tremain discusses two terms in her piece \“What Can I Add to Discourse Communities?\”.  She defines codemeshing and codeswitching and how they are connected to discourse communities. She wrote about how language is connected to power, in the sense that certain discourse communities will have a better view of you based on the language variety you use to communicate with them. The preferred language variety changes between Discourse communities. Hence, to best fit into all of your discourse communities, you must codeswitch and codemesh your language varieties."},
      {title: "When I switch and mesh", text: "Up until this point, I have been very careful not to specify whether I codeswitch or codemesh in different scenarios, usually even avoiding both terms completely by stating \"switching and meshing my language variety\". I think for this literacy narrative to be complete, a guideline or set of rules on what social contexts my personal writing identity leads me to codeswitch or codemesh for. However, I don’t think I can justifiably state a be-all end-all rule for what types of writing and what social context make it best to codeswitch or codemesh, or when best to do neither. However, since I have placed myself in many social contexts in the past, I have developed a good sense of when to do what when it comes to codeswitching and codemeshing. \nI think the best way to describe when my personal writing identity leads me to codeswitch and when it leads me to codemesh is to first define each of those terms in my own words, so you know in what sense I mean each word. For me, when one codeswitches, that means they, to the fullest extent of their ability, for some or the full length of the literacy one codeswitched for, completely changed their language variety from the one that best fits their writing identity to one that best fits the social context of the literacy. When one codemeshes, that means they, for some or the full length of the literacy one codemeshed for, intentionally and only partially changed their language variety from the variety that best fits their writing identity to align more closely with one that best fits the social context of the literacy. \nI think the best way to define when I should codeswitch or codemesh is to provide several examples of social contexts and scenarios of when my personal writing identity leads me to believe it would be best to or to not codemesh or codeswitch. I also plan to state what event(s) from my past have led me to choose to do that in each particular case. \nIn many formal social settings, I believe it is important to consider that you should speak or write in a language variety that is socially considered formal, and hence acceptable for that setting. I consider scholarly settings, such as class or writing an essay, to be formal, and I consider the American Southern language variety to not be formal, so I avoid using terms like y’all and ain’t in many scholarly settings. While living in Tennessee, I learned to say y’all and ain’t on occasion. But when I moved out of Tennessee, I learned it is not acceptable to use those terms in an Essay, and therefore I codeswitch to avoid doing that. There is an exception to this, of course. Imagine that scholarly setting was in Tennessee, filled with individuals whose literacy variety aligns with one that considers y’all and ain’t day-to-day terms. In that case, it would be acceptable to use those terms, and many of my teachers from Tennessee were fine with that. \n In nonformal settings, however, in which the individual or group I am communicating with uses a different language variety than I, I think codemeshing or codeswitching with their language variety would be beneficial. That is only if you plan to frequently exchange literacy with that Discourse community, and have done so in the past. However, in the event you only have one interaction with that group or individual, it is not necessarily wise to codemesh, because I don’t think you would benefit greatly from an interaction so brief, and it might be considered weird if you talk in someone else’s language variety the first time you talk to them. I learned this concept of nonformal codeswitching during the period in which I was switching schools every year. At the start of the year, when I first introduced myself to a new group of kids from a whole new area, if I tried immediately meshing or switching my language variety to theirs, then it likely wasn’t taken well. But closer to the end of each year, in some years, I found a friend group I frequently communicated with. In that case, it was beneficial for me to codemesh with my friend group's language variety. \nIt is also good to consider how, for some individuals, codeswitching or codemeshing to a handful of specific language varieties may not be wise. That is usually the case when the language variety of the Discourse community is that of a heritage literacy, and that heritage varies greatly from yours. However, in specific cases, it might actually be best to codeswitch in this scenario. For example, imagine you are on vacation in a foreign country in which the residents speak a different language from your preferred language variety, and it may be impossible or at least very difficult for many residents of that country to understand your preferred language variety. In that scenario, you should codeswitch, that is, change your language variety as completely as your ability allows you, to the preferred language of the residents of that country. I learned this on my trip to Japan this past summer. I know a small amount of the Japanese language, enough to ask basic questions and maybe maintain a brief, simple conversation, but not nearly enough to be considered fluent. At the beginning of my trip, I avoided using Japanese even when the Japanese individuals I interacted with did not understand much or any English, relying on gestures to refer to things or order when I knew the phrases to say it in the locals preferred language simply because I was worried that as a white man speaking a type of language variety that belongs a racial group I am not a part of might not be taken well. However, as my trip went on, it became obvious that speaking the preferred language of the individual or group I am speaking with when I am able, rather than the language they do not know well, is actually beneficial and allows me to communicate with a larger group of individuals. When I began speaking Japanese to the best of my ability, I felt as if I was able to communicate on a slightly more personal level with the locals, and began to understand their culture slightly better because of this."},
      {title: "Wrapping it up", text: "Due to my past experiences writing in a variety of environments, I have developed a system of meshing and mixing my language variety that allows me to meet social language standards and facilitates my ability to communicate effectively with many individuals. My frequent changing of environments has also caused me to experience literature in lots of Discourse communities, which has impacted my writing identity. Additionally, my past literacy sponsors have either directly helped me develop skills that have impacted my writing identity or they have done so indirectly by fueling additions to my identity kit, which shapes my writing identity."},
